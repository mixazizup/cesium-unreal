# Cesium for Unreal Engine

This is the Cesium plugin for Unreal Engine. It will eventually be published on the Unreal Marketplace, but for the moment it is intended to be included in an Unreal Engine game / project via git submodule. A demo and example of using this plugin may be found in the [cesium-unreal-demo repo](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-demo). Please see that repo for more information.
