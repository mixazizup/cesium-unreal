# Releasing a new version of Cesium for Unreal

This is the process we follow when releasing a new version of Cesium for Unreal on GitHub and on the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

* Verify that cesium-native's CHANGES.md is complete and accurate.
* Verify that cesium-native CI has completed successfully on all platforms.
* Verify that the submodule reference in cesium-unreal references the correction commit of cesium-native.
* Verify that cesium-unreal builds against the nominated cesium-native version and that everything works as expected.
* Tag the cesium-native release, e.g., `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "0.2.0 release"`
* Push the tag to github: `git push origin v0.2.0`
* Verify that cesium-unreal's CHANGES.md is complete and accurate.
* Tag the cesium-unreal release, e.g., `git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "1.1.0 release"`
* Push the tag to github: `git push origin v1.1.0`
* Wait for the tag CI build to complete, then download its `plugin-package-combined`. You can find it by switching to the tag in the GitHub UI, clicking the green tick in the header, and then clicking the Details button next to `plugin-package-combined`. While you're here, copy the download URL because you'll need it later.
* Create a new release on GitHub: https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal/releases/new. Upload the release ZIP above.

    * A note here - The **Create New Version** button (don't use this) is for adding a plugin that is for a different version of Unreal Engine. For example if there were different build for 4.25 and 4.26. Even if you accidentally click it, the box for 4.26 will be greyed out. Delete the accidentally added row by clicking the delete icon.
